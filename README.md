## Architecture

The platform is composed of 2 services:

- **Video Sharing Service**: this service is responsible for managing videos. It exposes a REST API that can be used to upload videos and share them with other users. The service also provides a Swagger UI to test the API. You can find the service's project [here](https://www.github.com/brunoaragao/video-sharing-platform-video-sharing-service).

- **Identity Service**: this service is responsible for managing user authentication. It exposes a REST API that can be used to authenticate users and generate JWT tokens. The service also provides a Swagger UI to test the API. You can find the service's project [here](https://www.github.com/brunoaragao/video-sharing-platform-identity-service).
